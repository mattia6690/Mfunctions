# Mfunctions

A package that provides basic R Function I use repeatedly for my research. It contains various functions for:

* Basic simplification as for folder creation, package installation etc.
* Basic mathematical expressions like sum of digits or binary conversion
* Geospatial operations dealing with the informations within a raster just like vectors

The package has no effective error handling implemented and the functions have to be considered as very generic
nevertheless the presented and commented functions could be helpful.
