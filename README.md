# Mfunctions

A package that provides basic R Function I encountered as useful during my Masters and PhD Thesis:

* Basic simplification Functions as for folder creation, package installation etc.
* Basic mathematical expressions like sum of digits or binary conversion
* Geospatial operations dealing with the informations within a raster just like vectors

The package has no effective error handling implemented and the functions have to be considered as very generic
nevertheless the presented and commented functions could be helpful

*last updated Readme: 26.07.17*
